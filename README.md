Classification of Beer Recipe Data into Segments using Cross-Validation and Ensemble Methods


# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset of beer recipes to classify them into segments based on various attributes. The project uses supervised learning techniques such as Decision Trees along with cross-validation and Ensemble Methods such as Random Forest, and XG Boost, to classify beer recipes into segments. The importance of different features in predicting beer attributes will also be examined.
